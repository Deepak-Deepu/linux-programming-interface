When using the Linux-specific reboot() system call to reboot the system, the second
argument, magic2, must be specified as one of a set of magic numbers (e.g.,
LINUX_REBOOT_MAGIC2 ). What is the significance of these numbers? (Converting them
to hexadecimal provides a clue.)?

Basically, a bit flip in an address can cause a program to think it is calling one system call when, in fact, it's calling the reboot() system call. Because reboot() is a very destructive, non-syncing operation that erases the state of the system -- thus erasing the evidence of the bit-flip problem that would otherwise be exposed as a program error or panic -- Linux includes extra protections around its successful use
